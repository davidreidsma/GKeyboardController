A Python script to help me control my GMMK (Glorious Modular Mechanical Keyboard https://www.pcgamingrace.com/search?q=gmmk) outside of the official software.

This is very unfinished.
If you're looking for better control of the GMMK (or lots of other RGB hardware) take a look at OpenRGB. The GMMK shows up with a different name, but it's there. https://github.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB
